                    <p> I literally cannot explain why but anytime a video game contains a fishing minigame, I go absolutely feral for it. Most of the time fishing minigames have such unique and fun approaches to how they function and I love checking them out. My favourite so far is the Stardew Valley fishing minigame. It's insanely addictive and you could cut farming out of the game and I would play it just for the fishing. In all honesty in Minecraft the fishing mechanics are very boring, but I love Minecraft so it gained a mention on this page. The Animal Crossing New Horizons fishing mechanic would be alright if I wasn't traumatized by the amount of sea bass. That is all.</p>
